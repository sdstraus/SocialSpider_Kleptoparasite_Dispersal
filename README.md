# 	Kleptoparasites of social spider colonies do not track hosts’ subdivided population structure

This repository contains the scripts and associated intermediate data and rds files for the genotype-by-sequencing analysis presented in "Kleptoparasites of social spider colonies do not track hosts’ subdivided population structure"

Straus S., Aviles L. 2022. Kleptoparasites of social spider colonies do not track hosts’ subdivided population structure. Molecular Ecology (Accepted).

# Overview
We used genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) to infer dipersal patterns of a social spider host and its kleptoparasites within and among three regions in eastern Ecuador. Each directory has its own _README.md file detailing the contents and use notes for the directory
